# APCS2 Final Project
THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info

Group Name: Blooners  
Period 3, Alan Chen, Alex Luo

## Overview

A simple recreation of BTD5 that consists of towers, a map, bloons that travel through the map, wave development(and respective bloons of such waves), and a simple GUI. 

## Instructions

**<u>Running the project</u>**: No extra steps or downloads needed. Just run it, and hopefully, everything will work.  

**<u>Placing towers</u>**: Click on one of the tower buttons on the right side, and then click somewhere on the map to place a tower. You cannot place if you're too poor, you cannot place on the track, and you cannot place too close to other towers.  

**<u>Upgrading towers</u>**: Click near the center of a placed tower to open the upgrade menu. There are 3 buttons (from left to right):
> 1) **Sell**: Removes the tower and refunds the specified amount of cash
> 2) **Upgrade path 1**: Upgrade the tower once on path 1, if you can afford it
> 3) **Upgrade path 2**: Upgrade the tower once on path 2, if you can afford it  

You can purchase upgrades from both paths, but when you buy 3 or more upgrades from one path, you are restricted to only buying up to 2 upgrades from the other.  

**<u>Cheats</u>**: If you wish to cheat, press the "C" key to open the cheat menu. You will find on the left side of the screen (from top to bottom):
> 1) **Toggle camo**: Toggles camo for spawned bloons from the panel (some towers cannot detect camo without certain upgrades)
> 2) **Toggle regrow**: Toggles regrow for spawned bloons from the panel (regenerate layers over time)
> 3) **Grid of bloons**: Spawns the specified bloon, with camo and/or regrow modifiers if you enabled them with their respective toggles
> 4) **HEALTH !!!**: Gives infinite lives
> 5) **MONEY !!!**: Gives infinite cash
> 6) **Remove bloons**: Removes all bloons currently on the map
> 7) **Skip wave**: Stops all current wave spawns and immediately starts the next wave
> 8) **Start next wave**: Immediately starts the next wave, but does NOT stop current wave spawns; this means bloons will keep spawning from the previous wave
